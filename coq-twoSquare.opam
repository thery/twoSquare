synopsis: "A proof of Fermat's theorem on sum of two squares."
description: """

A proof of Fermat's theorem on sum of two squares.
It is the proof that uses gaussian integers. This is done in ssreflect.
It contains two files :

********************************

gauss_int.v : the definition of gaussian integers

fermat2.v : the proof of Fermat's theorem

********************************

The final statement reads:

From mathcomp.contrib.sum_of_two_square
Require Import fermat2.

Check sum2stest.

sum2stest :

reflect
    (forall p,  prime p -> odd p -> p %| n -> odd (logn p n) -> p %% 4 = 1)
    (n is a sum_of_two_square)."""
